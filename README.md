# WhatsApp-Clone---Firebase
WhatsApp Clone build with React.js + Firebase for real time chatting

It uses material UI for all the icons / buttons and small components but most of the UI is custom build and styled using simple css

VITE was used for development / bundling.

You can visit here to DEMO the app, just use your google (gmail) account to login and it will save your user into React Context API until you refresh the app an load all of your chats, messages and your google account avatar.
